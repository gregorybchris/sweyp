# Sweyp
My version of the classic dice word game

## Description

You have 60 seconds to find as many words as you can. Words must have at least three letters and the words you find will show up on the left side of the screen. To reset the game use the 'R' key. 

## Running the Project

To run the project in the console use the provided run file:

```bash
./run
```

This will compile the java files, run the graphics for the program, and then clean up the compile files after program termination.

## Result
